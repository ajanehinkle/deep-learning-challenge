# Write a Report on the Neural Network Model

## For this part of the assignment, youâ€™ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

### The report should contain the following:

### Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The analysis is completed to better identify candidates that would qualify for Alphabet Soup.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

## Data Preprocessing

### What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? 

-The variable 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column is the target

### What variable(s) are the features for your model? 

- The feature variables are every other column that is not the target

### What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

- The EIN' and 'NAME' columns

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? 

- Neurons: 425

- Layers: 2

- Activation Functions: 130

All numbers other than layer amount were chosen at random.

### Were you able to achieve the target model performance? 

No, but the number got within 3 percent of the target performance.
